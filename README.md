## Installation

- Create a database named to-do-list,
- The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables that you will need to have this app work correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I would recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
- Open up your editor of choice and run an "npm install"
- Run "npm run server" in your terminal.
- Open a section terminal and run "npm run client"
- A broswer should open automatically at localhost:3000 - enjoy the app!

## Important Note
Don't forget to go to localhost:3000/admin to see the administrative side of the app!
